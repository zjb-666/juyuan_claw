# Local MCP Mode

**Status:** Implemented (initial cut). See `src/OpenClaw.Shared/Mcp/`, `src/OpenClaw.Shared/Mcp/McpHttpServer.cs`, and the Settings UI MCP section.

## Summary

The Windows tray app now ships a **local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** alongside its existing OpenClaw gateway client. The same node capabilities the agent reaches over the OpenClaw gateway WebSocket — `system.*`, `screen.*`, `canvas.*`, `camera.*`, `location.get`, `tts.*`, `stt.*`, `device.*`, and `browser.proxy` — are advertised, on the same machine, as MCP tools over `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`. Local-only `app.*` and `app.connection.*` tools are also exposed to MCP clients for tray automation and connection/pairing workflows; those are not registered with the remote gateway node transport.

This means any local MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, an MCP-aware CLI, a custom dev script) can reach into the running tray and drive Windows-native capabilities directly, without an OpenClaw gateway in the loop. The tray app can run in **MCP-only mode** with no gateway connection at all.

The implementation is structured so that **adding a new node capability automatically exposes it via MCP** — no MCP-side code changes required. That is the central design constraint and the main reason we built MCP in-process rather than as a separate adapter.

## Goals

1. **Single source of truth for capabilities.** A new `INodeCapability` registered with `WindowsNodeClient.RegisterCapability(...)` is reachable via every transport the tray supports. Today: gateway WebSocket and local MCP HTTP. Future transports (named pipe, gRPC, whatever) plug in the same way.
2. **Local-first development.** Capabilities can be exercised on Windows without standing up an OpenClaw gateway, without an account, without a gateway token, without pairing, and without a tunnel.
3. **Make MCP clients first-class consumers** of the OpenClaw native node, not afterthoughts. The tooling investment in capabilities (camera consent flows, exec approval policy, canvas WebView2 plumbing) pays off in both directions: agent-via-gateway and agent-via-local-MCP.

## Non-goals (for this iteration)

- **No remote authentication.** Loopback bind + Origin/Host checks keep the endpoint unreachable from any other machine. A local bearer token guards against untrusted local processes on the same box (see [Authentication](#authentication) below). We will revisit ACLs / multi-user when we want remote MCP, multiple users on one box, or shared dev VMs.
- **No SSE / streaming.** Plain JSON-RPC request/response is enough for the synchronous capabilities we have today.
- **No per-tool input schemas.** Capabilities don't expose schemas; MCP `inputSchema` is permissive (`{type: "object", additionalProperties: true}`). When/if `INodeCapability` grows a schema property, the MCP bridge picks it up with no other changes.
- **No port configuration UI.** Default `8765` is hardcoded. Easy to lift into `SettingsManager` later.

                            (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
```

The capability list lives on `NodeService`, *not* on `WindowsNodeClient`. That single change is what makes MCP-only mode possible: the gateway client is now optional. When it exists, `Register(cap)` pushes capabilities into both the local list and the gateway client's registration message. When it doesn't (MCP-only), capabilities still populate the local list and the MCP bridge serves them.

### MCP bridge

`OpenClaw.Shared/Mcp/McpToolBridge.cs` is transport-agnostic JSON-RPC 2.0. It implements:

- `initialize` — protocol version `2024-11-05`, server info.
- `tools/list` — flattens `_capabilities` into MCP tools. Tool name = command name (`"screen.snapshot"`); known commands get curated descriptions from `McpToolBridge.CommandDescriptions`; unknown commands fall back to `"{category} capability: {command}"`. `inputSchema` is permissive.
- `tools/call` — finds the capability via `INodeCapability.CanHandle(name)`, builds a `NodeInvokeRequest` (the same struct the gateway path uses), calls `ExecuteAsync`, wraps the result as MCP `content[].text`. Tool failures come back as `result.isError = true`, not JSON-RPC errors (per MCP spec — JSON-RPC errors are reserved for protocol issues).
- `ping`, `notifications/initialized` — protocol housekeeping.
- `notifications/cancelled` — cancels the active request whose JSON-RPC ID is
  supplied as `params.requestId`. A cancelled `tools/call` completes with an MCP
  tool error containing `cancelled`. If concurrent HTTP scheduling processes
  cancellation just before an already-sent call registers, the notification
  records a pending cancellation for five seconds. The first matching
  registration atomically consumes that tombstone and returns `cancelled` before
  capability execution begins, so correctness does not depend on scheduler
  timing. Repeated notifications for the same pending ID do not extend its
  original five-second lifetime. Pending cancellations and recent-completion
  guards are each capped at 1,024 entries;
  expired entries are pruned first and the oldest remaining entry is evicted at
  capacity. Because JSON-RPC IDs are client-scoped but this stateless HTTP
  transport has no client identity, duplicate active IDs are allowed and
  cancellation is ignored when more than one active call matches; this prevents
  one local client from cancelling another client when the collision is already
  observable. Request matching uses the decoded JSON string value or normalized
  arbitrary-precision JSON number value, while preserving the distinction
  between string and numeric IDs. A tombstone cannot predict a later
  cross-client ID collision, so it cancels the first matching registration;
  complete isolation would require client identity in the transport. A recent
  completion guard also prevents a late notification from poisoning immediate
  ID reuse.

The bridge takes a `Func<IReadOnlyList<INodeCapability>>` rather than a snapshot. Every `tools/list` re-reads the live list. This is what guarantees zero-cost capability addition — register a new capability after server start and it appears on the next `tools/list`.

Cancellation is cooperative and uses the same `CancellationToken` capability
contract as the gateway transport. Screen and camera operations propagate the
token through recording consent/countdown, camera admission, capture waits, and
recording shutdown. The HTTP request deadline remains a separate safety bound;
no command-specific transport deadlines are applied.

### HTTP transport

`OpenClaw.Shared/Mcp/McpHttpServer.cs` is `System.Net.HttpListener` bound to `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`. Loopback-only by construction; not reachable from any other machine even with firewall holes. A defensive `IPAddress.IsLoopback` check on each request acts as belt-and-suspenders.

`GET /` returns a friendly text probe. `POST /` is JSON-RPC. Anything else → `405`. When a bearer token is configured, every verb must pass the token gate before method dispatch.

## Authentication

The HTTP transport requires a bearer token on every request. Defense-in-depth on top of loopback bind + Origin/Host checks: if an attacker can run code in *any* local user context they can reach `127.0.0.1:8765`, so we don't want the listener to be open-by-construction.

**Where the token lives.** `%APPDATA%\OpenClawTray\mcp-token.txt`. The exact path is composed by `NodeService.McpTokenPath` from `SettingsManager.SettingsDirectoryPath`, so the test-suite override `OPENCLAW_TRAY_DATA_DIR` isolates the token file too. The file inherits the parent directory's ACL — by default only the current user (and SYSTEM/Administrators) can read it.

**When it's created.** Lazily, on the first `NodeService.StartMcpServer()` call — i.e. the first time the user enables Local MCP Server in Settings and saves. **Until that toggle has been on at least once, the file does not exist.** This trips up users who try to grab the token before flipping the switch.

**How long it is.** 32 bytes of CSPRNG output, base64url-encoded with padding stripped → **43 ASCII characters** (~256 bits of entropy). See `McpAuthToken.Generate()`.

**Lifetime.** The token is **persistent across tray restarts**. It's only regenerated if the file is deleted or its contents are emptied. There is no automatic rotation.

**On the wire.** Every request must carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when the server has a configured token. Missing or wrong token → `401 Unauthorized` with no body. `GET /` remains a "yes I'm here" probe after auth passes.

**How users find it.** Settings → Developer Mode → MCP section shows the live token (masked, with Reveal/Copy buttons) and the storage path. For agents that read from disk (Claude Code, custom scripts), pointing them at `McpTokenPath` is preferable to embedding the token in their prompt or config — the path is stable, the token is a secret. For agents that only accept literal bearer values in config (Claude Desktop, Cursor), use Copy.

### Settings model

Two independent toggles in `SettingsData`:

```csharp
public bool EnableNodeMode { get; set; }      // open WebSocket to gateway
public bool EnableMcpServer { get; set; }     // run local MCP HTTP server
```

| `EnableNodeMode` | `EnableMcpServer` | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| false | false | Operator-only (legacy default) |
| false | true | **MCP server only, no gateway** |
| true | false | Gateway node, no MCP |
| true | true | Gateway node + MCP |

Settings UI exposes both toggles in the Advanced section, with the live MCP endpoint URL and current status (`Listening` / `Stopped — save and restart to start` / `Disabled`).

A legacy `McpOnlyMode` field is migrated automatically on load and never re-written.

MCP startup is reported from the actual listener state. `NodeService.McpStartupError` is populated when capability registration or the HTTP listener fails, and MCP-only startup is not treated as successful unless the loopback MCP server is running. Tray, Permissions, and Command Center surfaces show local MCP-only separately from gateway connectivity so a working local MCP listener is never presented as a gateway connection.

## Why this matters

### Testing

The tray's most interesting code lives in capabilities: `system.run` (LocalCommandRunner + the V2 exec-approval coordinator), `screen.snapshot` (Windows.Graphics.Capture + GraphicsCapturePicker), `canvas.*` (WebView2 with trusted origin enforcement), `camera.snap`/`camera.clip` (MediaCapture + consent prompt), and `location.get` (Windows.Devices.Geolocation). All of that has nontrivial Windows-only behavior and almost none of it is currently exercised end-to-end without first standing up a gateway and authenticating.

Local MCP changes that. Concrete benefits:

- **Manual smoke tests in seconds.** `curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/ -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'` validates that the capability dispatch path works, the WinUI dispatcher marshaling is correct, the result shape matches expectations. No gateway, no gateway token, no pairing, no SSH tunnel.
- **Reproducible bug reports.** A repro becomes a `tools/call` body the bug filer can paste verbatim. No "what was the gateway doing at the time."
- **Integration tests against a real instance.** A future `tests/integration/` project can spin up the tray in MCP-only mode, fire JSON-RPC, assert results. The same test bodies a developer runs by hand are the same ones CI runs. (Harnessing WinUI itself in CI is harder, but the bridge logic — `McpToolBridge` — is already covered by `McpToolBridgeTests` with no UI involvement.)
- **Coverage for the dispatch path itself.** `WindowsNodeClient`'s capability-routing logic (`CanHandle` → `ExecuteAsync`) was previously only exercised against a live gateway. The MCP server hits the same code paths, so any local MCP test is implicit coverage of the gateway dispatch.
- **Bridge unit tests already exist.** `tests/OpenClaw.Shared.Tests/McpToolBridgeTests.cs` (9 cases) covers initialize, tools/list, runtime capability registration, tool calls, unknown tools, capability failures, JSON-RPC unknown method, notifications, and parse errors. These are pure C# unit tests with fake capabilities — no HTTP, no UI, no gateway.

### Access from CLIs and agents

The exact same node tools the OpenClaw gateway uses are now invocable by any local MCP-aware client:

- **Claude Code** (this CLI). Add to `~/.claude.json` or per-project `.mcp.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "openclaw-tray": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  The agent then sees `screen.snapshot`, `system.run`, `canvas.*`, etc. as tools, with whatever arguments the capability accepts.

- **Claude Desktop.** Same config shape under MCP servers.
- **Cursor.** Same.
- **GitHub Copilot CLI / Copilot in the terminal.** As MCP support lands in those clients, the endpoint is already there.
- **Custom dev scripts.** Anything that can speak HTTP + JSON-RPC. A 30-line Python or Node helper can drive the entire capability surface.

In all cases the user gets a Windows-native agent experience without OpenClaw infrastructure. They can be entirely offline w.r.t. an OpenClaw gateway and still hand the LLM a working set of "do something on my Windows box" tools.

### Current command surface

The canonical command descriptions live in `OpenClaw.Shared\Mcp\McpToolBridge.CommandDescriptions`; `OpenClaw.WinNode.Cli.Tests\SkillMdDriftTests` keeps `src\OpenClaw.WinNode.Cli\skill.md` in sync with that documented capability surface. The live `tools/list` output may also include newly registered capabilities with fallback descriptions before prose is updated.

Gateway/node command groups currently include:

- `system.notify`, `system.run`, `system.run.prepare`, `system.which`, `system.execApprovals.get`, `system.execApprovals.set`
- `canvas.present`, `canvas.hide`, `canvas.navigate`, `canvas.eval`, `canvas.snapshot`, `canvas.a2ui.push`, `canvas.a2ui.reset`, `canvas.a2ui.dump`, `canvas.caps`, `canvas.a2ui.pushJSONL`
- `screen.snapshot`, `screen.record`
- `camera.list`, `camera.snap`, `camera.clip`
- `stt.transcribe`, `stt.listen`, `stt.status`
- `tts.speak`, `tts.status`
- `location.get`
- `device.info`, `device.status`
- `browser.proxy`

Local MCP-only app control commands currently include:

- `app.navigate`, `app.status`, `app.sessions`, `app.agents`, `app.nodes`, `app.config.get`, `app.settings.get`, `app.settings.set`, `app.menu`, `app.search`, `app.dashboard.url`
- Chat automation: `app.chat.snapshot`, `app.chat.send`, `app.chat.reset`
- Connection diagnostics/automation: `app.connection.status`, `app.connection.gateways`, `app.connection.applySetupCode`, `app.connection.connectSharedToken`, `app.connection.pendingApprovals`, `app.connection.approveDevicePairing`, `app.connection.rejectDevicePairing`, `app.connection.approveNodePairing`, `app.connection.rejectNodePairing`, `app.connection.reconnect`, `app.connection.reconnectNode`

For connection troubleshooting, prefer `app.connection.status` over the older
`app.status` summary. It is read-only and returns the manager-owned
operator/node snapshot, active gateway metadata, credential source/status,
MCP listener state, browser-proxy shared-token caveat, pending approval commands,
retry hints inferred from recent diagnostics, and recent diagnostic events.
`app.connection.gateways` lists saved gateway records with credential presence
booleans only; it never returns token values.

Example chat automation smoke:

```powershell
winnode --command app.chat.send --params '{"message":"hello from local MCP"}'
```

### Dev acceleration when building new features

This is the strongest argument for making MCP a first-class citizen, not an afterthought.

When a contributor adds a new capability — say, `clipboard.read`, `clipboard.write`, `windows.list`, `audio.transcribe`, `git.status`, `office.draft_email` — today the workflow looks like:

1. Implement `INodeCapability`.
2. Wire it into `NodeService.RegisterCapabilities()`.
3. Stand up a gateway, authenticate, pair the device, etc., to test.
4. Drive the capability from within an agent conversation, observing logs and taking screenshots to confirm correctness.

With MCP in-process the workflow shortens to:

1. Implement `INodeCapability`.
2. Wire it into `NodeService.RegisterCapabilities()`.
3. Restart the tray. The new tool is *immediately* visible to any local MCP client (`tools/list` re-reads the registry every call), and to manual `curl` tests.

The dev loop for capabilities is now identical to the dev loop for any local HTTP server: edit, restart, hit the endpoint with the local MCP bearer token, observe. No gateway, no agent, no gateway auth.

This compounds when you stack it with Claude Code or Cursor on the same machine. A contributor can:

- Open the repo in their IDE.
- Run the tray with `EnableMcpServer = true`.
- Have Claude Code connected to the same MCP endpoint.
- Iterate on a new capability while the agent — using that very capability — helps drive the iteration. The capability under development can be invoked by the assistant on the next turn after a tray restart. That's a tight self-hosted feedback loop.

It also reduces the cost of "speculative" capabilities. Today, adding a capability has a tax: it must be useful enough to justify the extra surface in the gateway/agent stack. With local MCP, a contributor can build a capability speculatively, validate it against their own MCP-aware agent, and only later decide whether to formalize it for gateway use. That lowers the bar for experimentation.

## Security model

The server is built on several defensive layers, not just one. Loopback alone is *not* sufficient — a browser tab the user opens is also on the loopback interface, so a malicious page could otherwise reach `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` directly.

1. **Loopback bind.** `HttpListener` is registered with the prefix `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`. The Windows kernel binds the listening socket to the loopback interface only — packets from other interfaces are not delivered to it. Firewall configuration is irrelevant. Defends against: another machine on the network.
2. **Defensive `IsLoopback` check.** Each incoming request validates `ctx.Request.RemoteEndPoint.Address`. Belt-and-suspenders for #1.
3. **CSRF / browser gate.** Each request is rejected if any of the following holds:
   - the request carries an `Origin` header (real MCP clients — Claude Desktop, Cursor, Claude Code, curl — never send `Origin`; browsers always do for cross-origin fetches);
   - the `Host` header is anything other than `127.0.0.1[:port]` or `localhost[:port]` (defends against DNS-rebinding pivots);
   - on `POST`, the `Content-Type` is anything other than `application/json` (forces a CORS preflight from a browser, which we never satisfy).
   - the request body exceeds 4 MiB (DoS / OOM cap).

   Together these three checks force a malicious cross-origin browser fetch into a CORS preflight that we deliberately do not honor (no `Access-Control-Allow-*` is ever emitted), so the actual call is blocked before reaching capability code.
4. **Bearer token.** Every request must include the persistent local MCP bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`) once the server has created `%APPDATA%\OpenClawTray\mcp-token.txt`. This blocks drive-by local clients that know the port but cannot read the per-user token file.
5. **Concurrency cap.** A semaphore limits in-flight handlers to 8. A misbehaving local client cannot pin every threadpool thread on long-running screen/camera calls.
6. **Capability-level controls remain in force.** The V2 exec-approval coordinator still gates `system.run`. Camera and screen capture still go through Windows consent flows. MCP doesn't bypass any of those.

**Authentication is local bearer-token based.** The token is persistent, generated by the tray, stored in the current user's OpenClawTray data directory, and verified before MCP method dispatch. It is defense-in-depth rather than a hard sandbox boundary: a malicious process already running as the same user may still be able to read user-profile files or invoke native APIs directly. If we need stronger isolation for shared machines or low-trust local processes, the next step is scoped or per-call tokens issued by the tray, not URL ACLs or HTTPS — both add deployment pain without solving the same-user trust problem.

### Verifying the gate

These should all be **rejected** with `403 Forbidden`:

```powershell
# Browser pretending to come from another origin
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/ -H "Origin: https://evil.com" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'

# DNS rebinding attempt
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/ -H "Host: evil.com" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

This should be **rejected** with `415`:

```powershell
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/ -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"ping"}'
```

These should **succeed**:

```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/ -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"   # GET probe
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/ -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"ping"}'
```

## What's deliberately deferred

These are reasonable next steps but explicitly out of scope for the initial implementation:

1. **Per-tool input schemas.** Add an `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, JsonElement> InputSchemas` (or per-command descriptor) to `INodeCapability`. The MCP bridge's `HandleToolsList` picks them up automatically. Until then, MCP clients see permissive schemas and the agent has to figure out arg shapes from descriptions and trial-and-error.
2. ~~**Authentication.**~~ Implemented. See [Authentication](#authentication) below.
3. **Streamable HTTP / SSE.** For long-running tools (`screen.record`, future `audio.transcribe`), MCP supports streaming progress. The bridge needs to learn about it and the HTTP server needs to optionally upgrade.
4. **Resource and prompt support.** MCP has `resources/*` and `prompts/*` methods we currently no-op. Notifications, recent activity, channel state could be modeled as MCP resources.
5. **Configurable port.** Move `McpDefaultPort` into `SettingsManager`. Probably also pick a free port at startup if the default is in use, and surface the actual port in the Settings UI.
6. **Setup Wizard step.** Today the Settings Advanced section is the only way to enable MCP. The Setup Wizard could offer it as a one-click option, especially attractive for users who don't run a gateway at all.

## Quick verification

With the tray running and `EnableMcpServer = true`:

```powershell
# Server is up
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/ -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# List tools
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/ `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'

# Take a screenshot of the primary monitor
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/ `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"screen.snapshot"}}'
```

For a simpler local CLI smoke test, run `winnode --list-tools`; it loads the
same token file automatically.

For agent-driven validation, use the repo-local skill
`.agents/skills/openclaw-proof-validation/SKILL.md`. MCP/node changes need live
tool discovery plus invocation proof using `winnode` or raw MCP JSON-RPC.

## Adding or changing node commands

Every new Windows node command must remain first-class over local MCP. Register
it in the capability path used by `NodeService`, update
`McpToolBridge.CommandDescriptions`, update
`src/OpenClaw.WinNode.Cli/skill.md`, and add focused tests. `SkillMdDriftTests`
guards against drift between capabilities, MCP descriptions, and `winnode` docs.

PR proof for a new command should paste `winnode --list-tools` plus the command
invocation, or raw MCP `tools/list` plus `tools/call`; include gateway invoke
output when gateway-mediated behavior changed and a gateway is available.

For Claude Code, drop this into `.mcp.json` at the repo root or `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openclaw-tray": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
