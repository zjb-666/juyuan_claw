# OpenClaw Windows node — architecture ledger

This document is the **living source of truth** for the architecture refactor
that decomposes the repository's god objects. It is required reading before you
touch any file listed in the ledger below.

Its job is to stop the refactor from silently regressing: when a PR moves a
responsibility out of a god object, it records the move here and (for
high-regression closures) adds a guard test. A later PR that tries to move the
work back then shows up as either a visible ledger edit or a failing test.

See `AGENTS.md` → "Architecture Guardrails" for the hard rules, and the full
multi-PR refactor plan for the reasoning behind each boundary.

## How to use this document

1. **Before editing** a file named in the ledger, read its row(s). Do not add
   back anything a row marks `closed`.
2. **When you extract** a responsibility, in the same PR:
   - Flip/add the ledger row for the new owner to `authoritative`.
   - Mark the vacated responsibility in the old owner as `closed`.
   - Update the "when you touch file X, extract toward Y" guidance below.
   - Add a guard test for the closure when a silent revert would be dangerous.
3. **Prefer behavioral/golden guards.** Use `source-shape` guards only for a
   concrete prohibited pattern (a banned helper signature, a forbidden direct
   constructor call), never for broad architectural wishes, and always with a
   `retirement_condition`.

## Ownership rules

- **View** (XAML + code-behind): layout, named-control wiring, lifecycle event
  forwarding, minimal WinUI-only adapters. No gateway JSON parsing, no polling
  loops, no settings mutation, no imperative row factories.
- **ViewModel / Presenter** (`OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI/ViewModels`, `.../Presentation`):
  observable state, commands, pure projection. WinUI-free where practical — no
  `Microsoft.UI.Xaml`, no `Application.Current`, no `Window`/`Frame`/`Brush`/`Color`,
  no concrete `SettingsManager`. Unit-tested.
- **Service**: IO, gateway calls, registry/settings persistence, timers, process
  execution, WebSocket/MCP hosting. No UI types. No background work started from
  constructors.
- **App** (`App.xaml.cs`): composition root and top-level lifecycle only.

## Ledger

The ledger is machine-readable and validated by
`OpenClaw.Shared.Tests/Architecture/ArchitectureLedgerConsistencyTests.cs`.
Rows live between the BEGIN/END markers, one per line, pipe-delimited, with a
leading and trailing pipe. Columns, in order:

`id | status | old_owner | closed_responsibility | new_owner | allowed_residue | invariant | guard_test | guard_type | retirement_condition`

- `status`: `planned` | `authoritative` | `closed`
- `guard_type`: `behavioral` | `golden` | `source-shape` | `review-only`
- For `authoritative`/`closed` rows, `guard_test` must name a test as `Type.Method`
  (validated for format), OR `guard_type` must be `review-only` with a real
  rationale in `guard_test` (placeholders like `-`/`none` are rejected).
- For `behavioral`/`golden` rows, the named `guard_test` must actually exist in
  the `tests/` source tree — the consistency test scans for it, so renaming or
  deleting a guard without updating the ledger fails CI.
- `source-shape` rows must set a concrete `retirement_condition`.
- No literal `|` characters inside a cell (they break the pipe-delimited parse).
- Use `-` for a genuinely empty cell (except where a value is required above).

## Deferred test builders

`DeviceIdentityBuilder` and `SetupContextBuilder` are intentionally **not** in
`OpenClaw.TestSupport` yet. `DeviceIdentity` is a stateful Ed25519 key/file
service (not a value type) and `SetupContext` needs setup logger/journal/command-runner
fakes. Both will be added alongside their subsystem PRs (gateway protocol and
SetupEngine, respectively) so `OpenClaw.TestSupport` does not take a heavy
dependency on `OpenClaw.SetupEngine` prematurely.
