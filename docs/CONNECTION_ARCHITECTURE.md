# Connection Architecture

This document describes the gateway connection system — how the tray app discovers, authenticates with, and maintains connections to OpenClaw gateways.

## Project structure

Connection management lives in three layers:

```
OpenClaw.Shared (net10.0)           — WebSocket transport, gateway protocol, device identity
    ↑
OpenClaw.Connection (net10.0)       — connection lifecycle, registry, credentials, state machine
    ↑
OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI (net10.0-windows) — UI app, tray icon, pages, windows
```

**OpenClaw.Shared** owns the low-level gateway clients (`OpenClawGatewayClient`, `WindowsNodeClient`, `WebSocketClientBase`), device identity/signing (`DeviceIdentity`), protocol models, and the `IOperatorGatewayClient` interface.

`WindowsNodeClient` also owns gateway invocation lifetime at the transport
boundary. Active invokes are registered by invoke ID in a focused cancellation
registry, linked to the node connection lifetime, and cancelled individually by
the gateway `node.invoke.cancel` event. Active invocations atomically transition
to cancelled or completed when capability execution returns; whichever
transition wins determines the protocol outcome. Capability implementations
remain responsible for cooperative cancellation of their own underlying work.

**OpenClaw.Connection** owns all connection management: `GatewayConnectionManager`, `GatewayRegistry`, `CredentialResolver`, `ConnectionStateMachine`, `NodeConnector`, `SshTunnelService/Manager`, `SetupCodeDecoder`, and all connection interfaces/DTOs/enums. This project has zero WinUI dependencies and is independently testable.

**OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI** consumes the connection layer through interfaces. It never creates gateway clients directly — `GatewayConnectionManager` owns that entirely.

## Consumer API

The tray app interacts with three main objects:

### `IGatewayConnectionManager` — connection lifecycle

```csharp
// Lifecycle
ConnectAsync(gatewayId?)          // connect to active or specified gateway
DisconnectAsync()                 // tear down all connections
ReconnectAsync()                  // disconnect + connect
SwitchGatewayAsync(gatewayId)     // switch to different gateway (stops tunnel, resets state)
ApplySetupCodeAsync(setupCode)    // decode QR/setup code → register → connect

// State
CurrentSnapshot                   // immutable GatewayConnectionSnapshot
OperatorClient                    // IOperatorGatewayClient for sending gateway requests
ActiveGatewayUrl                  // which gateway we're connected to
Diagnostics                       // ring buffer of connection events

// Events
StateChanged                      // snapshot updated → UI refreshes tray icon, status
OperatorClientChanged             // client swapped → rewire data event handlers
DiagnosticEvent                   // timeline entry for Connection Status window
```

### `GatewayRegistry` — gateway catalog

```csharp
GetAll() / GetById(id) / GetActive()   // read configured gateways
AddOrUpdate(record)                     // create or update a gateway record
SetActive(id)                           // switch which gateway is active
FindByUrl(url)                          // lookup by URL (deduplication)
Save() / Load()                         // persist to gateways.json
GetIdentityDirectory(id)                // per-gateway identity directory path
MigrateFromSettings(...)                // one-time legacy migration
```

### `IOperatorGatewayClient` — gateway API (via `OperatorClientChanged`)

The operator client is received through the `OperatorClientChanged` event. The app subscribes to data events (sessions, nodes, usage, config, pairing, models, agents, etc.) and calls request methods for chat, node invocations, and configuration.

### Chat timeline event routing

Inbound chat and agent timeline events must include the gateway's canonical `sessionKey`. The tray client must not synthesize a literal `main` key for keyless inbound events, because that can merge unrelated events into the wrong timeline. When a keyless chat or agent event arrives, the tray drops it and raises a one-shot diagnostic so the protocol issue is visible without exposing the dropped message contents.

## Startup wiring (App.xaml.cs)

```
1. Create GatewayRegistry(SettingsManager.SettingsDirectoryPath)
2. Load gateway registry from gateways.json
3. Create CredentialResolver(DeviceIdentityFileReader.Instance)
4. Create GatewayClientFactory()
5. Create ConnectionDiagnostics()
6. Create NodeConnector(logger, diagnostics)
7. Wire NodeConnector.ClientCreated → NodeService.AttachClient
8. Create SshTunnelService(logger)
9. Create GatewayConnectionManager(resolver, factory, registry, logger,
                                    identityStore, nodeConnector, node mode flag,
                                    diagnostics, tunnelService)
10. Subscribe to OperatorClientChanged → wire/unwire 25+ data event handlers
11. Subscribe to StateChanged → update tray icon + hub window
12. Ensure NodeService exists before gateway initialization
13. Call InitializeGatewayClient() → connects to active gateway
```

Settings changes are classified by `SettingsChangeClassifier.Classify()` which compares `ConnectionSettingsSnapshot` before/after to determine the minimum reconnect action:

| Impact | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `NoOp` | Nothing |
| `UiOnly` | Nothing (UI preferences only) |
| `CapabilityReload` | Reload node capabilities |
| `NodeReconnectRequired` | Reconnect node only |
| `OperatorReconnectRequired` | Reconnect operator (SSH tunnel changed) |
| `FullReconnectRequired` | Full tear down and reconnect (gateway URL changed) |

## Connection state machine

`ConnectionStateMachine` (internal) drives state transitions for both operator and node roles:

```
Idle → Connecting → Connected
                  → PairingRequired → (approved) → Connected
                  → Error → (reconnect) → Connecting
                  → RateLimited
```

`OverallConnectionState` is derived from both roles:

| Operator | Node | Overall |
|----------|------|---------|
| Error | * | Error |
| PairingRequired | * | PairingRequired |
| Connected | Connected | Ready |
| Connected | Error/Rejected | Degraded |
| Connected | PairingRequired | PairingRequired |
| Connected | Connecting | Connecting |
| Connected | Idle while Node mode is intended | Degraded |
| Connected | Disabled/Off | Ready |

`GatewayConnectionSnapshot.NodeConnectionIntended` records the Node mode intent used by the manager's state machine. If Node mode is enabled but node startup is skipped, blocked, or missing a node credential, the manager publishes a blocked node snapshot (`NodeState=Error`, `NodeError=...`) instead of leaving the node idle and letting tray surfaces report a healthy connection.

### Status projection and legacy ledger

`GatewayConnectionManager.CurrentSnapshot` is the lifecycle truth. Tray/UI state
must treat `AppState.Status` / `ConnectionStatus` as a derived compatibility
projection only, produced from the manager snapshot by
`ConnectionStatusPresenter`. New connection diagnostics should read
`GatewayConnectionSnapshot`, `GatewayRegistry`, and `ConnectionDiagnostics`
directly instead of writing a second runtime model.

Current derived compatibility debt:

| Surface | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `AppState.Status` | Derived read-side adapter | The only writer is the manager `StateChanged` handler, which maps the snapshot through `ConnectionStatusPresenter` for older UI consumers. |
| `ConnectionStatus` enum | Retained | Still used by shared gateway/client and tray read-side surfaces. Do not remove it until protocol/client and UI consumers are separated in a smaller migration. |
| Command Center / tray projections | Mixed | New diagnostics use snapshot-derived DTOs. Some older warnings still read `AppStateSnapshot.Status`; those reads are compatibility gates, not lifecycle ownership. |

The local MCP `app.connection.status` command is the agent-facing projection of
this model. It reports effective mode/state, active gateway metadata,
operator/node credential resolution, MCP runtime state, browser-proxy caveats,
pending approval actions, retry hints from diagnostics, and recent diagnostic
events without exposing token values.

## Gateway registry and persistence

`GatewayRegistry` is the source of truth for configured gateways:

```
%APPDATA%\OpenClawTray\gateways.json           — gateway records
%APPDATA%\OpenClawTray\gateways\<id>\          — per-gateway identity directory
%APPDATA%\OpenClawTray\gateways\<id>\device-key-ed25519.json  — keypair + tokens
```

Each `GatewayRecord` contains: `Id`, `Url`, `FriendlyName`, `SharedGatewayToken`, `BootstrapToken`, `LastConnected`, `SshTunnel` config, `IsLocal`, `RequiresV2Signature`, `SetupManagedDistroName`, and `BrowserControlPort`. The `IdentityDirName` property is computed from `Id`.

Many gateway records may be saved, but only `ActiveId` in `gateways.json` is the effective gateway. Active gateway changes must be made through `GatewayRegistry.SetActive(...)` and saved immediately by connection flows that switch or apply credentials. `SetActive(...)` raises `GatewayRegistry.Changed`, so UI and diagnostics can observe a gateway switch even before the new connection finishes. Each active gateway resolves identity from `%APPDATA%\OpenClawTray\gateways\<id>\`; old gateway events are ignored by `GatewayConnectionManager` generation + gateway-id guards after a switch.

`SettingsManager` still owns general tray settings (node mode, MCP mode, SSH tunnel toggles, notifications, UI preferences). It may read legacy `Token` / `BootstrapToken` JSON fields into memory for migration, but save must not write those legacy credential fields back.

## Credential precedence

Credential resolution order is intentionally strict:

1. **Stored device token** in the per-gateway identity directory.
2. **`GatewayRecord.SharedGatewayToken`** — shared token for HTTP/chat surfaces.
3. **`GatewayRecord.BootstrapToken`** — one-time setup, limited scopes.
4. **No credential** — caller logs and skips client init.

The invariant is that a paired device token always wins. Do not downgrade a paired operator or node to a shared/bootstrap token, because that can reduce scopes or trigger unnecessary re-pairing.

**`CredentialResolver`** implements the precedence for WebSocket connections (operator and node roles). It also returns a detailed `GatewayCredentialResolution` so the active snapshot and diagnostics can distinguish `Resolved`, `Missing`, `Unreadable`, `Corrupt`, `FallbackUsed`, and `BootstrapRequired`. Shared-token-only gateways are a clean resolved state when no paired device token exists. If a stored per-gateway device token is unreadable or corrupt and the resolver falls back to a shared/bootstrap token, `GatewayConnectionSnapshot` preserves that fallback status instead of reporting only the token source.

Unreadable/corrupt identity fallback is a credential-resolution diagnostic, not permission to replace an existing keypair. A readable stored device token still always wins. When the per-gateway identity file cannot be read or parsed, resolution may identify a same-gateway shared/bootstrap credential, but gateway client construction fails closed until the persisted identity is readable or the user explicitly resets pairing. OpenClaw never regenerates, overwrites, or otherwise changes the identity path on a load failure. The snapshot and diagnostics report the persisted-identity error so UI and diagnostics can prompt repair or explicit re-pair. Credential reads never fall back to another gateway's identity directory.

Node credential precedence follows the same invariant with a distinct stored token:

1. **Stored node device token** in the per-gateway identity directory.
2. **`GatewayRecord.SharedGatewayToken`** — shared token fallback when no paired node token exists.
3. **`GatewayRecord.BootstrapToken`** — one-time setup, limited scopes.
4. **No credential** — caller logs and skips node client init.

**`InteractiveGatewayCredentialResolver`** resolves credentials for HTTP surfaces (chat URL `?token=` auth). It **prefers SharedGatewayToken** over DeviceToken because HTTP endpoints expect the shared token, not the per-device WebSocket token. Browser proxy diagnostics should treat the missing shared token as a browser-control caveat, not as proof that the operator or node gateway connection is disconnected.

## Self-recovery and automatic local-gateway repair

Two orthogonal self-healing behaviors keep the connection reliable without dead-ending the user:

### Stale device-token self-recovery (operator + node)

The gateway may reject a stored device token with the structured code `AUTH_DEVICE_TOKEN_MISMATCH` (a rotated/revoked/replaced device token) — distinct from a wrong *shared* token. `GatewayErrorClassifier` is the single classifier for this: `ClassifyWithCode(message, ...codes)` inspects the structured `error.code`/`error.details.code` **before** the textual heuristic and returns the exact `GatewayErrorKind.DeviceTokenMismatch`, keeping a stale *device* token (auto-recoverable) separate from a wrong *shared* token (`Auth`, not device-recoverable). Broad `GatewayErrorKind.TokenDrift` remains a manual re-pair signal for UI copy.

On a device-token mismatch, the manager clears **only the rejected role's** device token and reconnects, letting `CredentialResolver` fall back to the same record's `SharedGatewayToken` (preferred) or `BootstrapToken`. This kills the post-setup "need a new token" dead end (setup clears the bootstrap token once pairing is durable, but the shared token remains). Operator recovery runs in `TryScheduleOperatorTokenRecovery`; node recovery is driven off the node client's classified `INodeConnectorTelemetryEvents.ConnectionFailure(GatewayErrorKind)` — the manager's `OnNodeConnectionFailure` queues `HandleNodeDeviceTokenMismatchAsync` off the connector's dispatch lock (capturing lifecycle+node generations at fire time and re-checking `IsCurrentNodeAttempt` before/after the transition semaphore). A per-gateway, per-role attempt guard (reset on handshake success / node pairing) prevents clear→reconnect→mismatch loops.

**Security — trust gate and endpoint provenance.** Clearing a device token downgrades to the more powerful shared/bootstrap credential, so `IsRecoverySafeEndpoint` restricts recovery to trusted endpoints: an owned SSH tunnel, a validated TLS (`wss`/`https`) endpoint, or — for a setup-managed WSL loopback gateway — a listener proven by `ManagedLocalGatewayPortProvenanceService` to be the Windows WSL relay. Loopback is not treated as identity by itself: an unknown listener or a proven obsolete native OpenClaw gateway blocks fallback, so a wrong local process cannot return a device-token mismatch to induce disclosure of the shared credential. A plain `ws://` remote endpoint is never eligible.

### Automatic managed-local WSL gateway repair (tray)

For an app-owned setup-managed local WSL gateway (`WslKeepAlivePolicy.IsSetupManagedLocalRecord` — never SSH/remote/ambiguous-localhost), the tray owns process supervision, keeping it out of the connection layer. `ManagedLocalGatewayAutoRepairMonitor` watches the operator connection and, when it is positively transport-unreachable (`GatewayErrorKind.Network`/`Server`, plus a cold-start `Connecting` state with no failure yet; never unknown/auth/pairing/rate-limit/scope/TLS/tunnel/token-drift) for a sustained window, invokes `ManagedLocalGatewayRepairCoordinator`. A typed `LocalPortConflict` is also repairable because its remediation is provenance-gated rather than a blind process restart. The monitor honors a **startup grace** (so a slow WSL cold start is not interrupted), a per-gateway unhealthy threshold and cooldown, a manager-owned explicit disconnect/stop intent, and a settings **kill switch** (`SettingsData.EnableManagedLocalGatewayAutoRepair`, default on).

**Default-on product contract and macOS parity.** App-installed local gateways are supervised by default for both fresh setups and upgrades, matching the macOS local-mode contract where launchd supervision is active unless OpenClaw is paused. Fresh Windows setup writes `EnableManagedLocalGatewayAutoRepair=true` explicitly; an existing settings file that predates the field deserializes to the same default. This enrollment is restricted to records whose setup-managed ownership is positively linked to the installed endpoint. Manual localhost, repointed, SSH, and remote records are never adopted. The user-facing controls are **Disconnect** and **Stop** on the Connection page: either records explicit operator intent and suppresses automatic restart, process remediation, and reconnect until the operator explicitly connects/starts again. An explicitly persisted `false` remains available as a policy/debug kill switch and is never overwritten by setup merge.

`ManagedLocalGatewayRepairCoordinator` **probes before it restarts**: if the gateway is already reachable it just reconnects (the macOS "attach" path); only a genuinely-down gateway triggers a WSL distro restart (via `WslGatewayController`), a keepalive re-arm (`WslGatewayKeepAliveService.TryEnsureAsync`), and a reconnect. For the native-vs-WSL collision case, `ManagedLocalGatewayPortProvenanceService` classifies listeners by address and proves process command line plus scheduled-task/profile lineage. It automatically disables/stops only a fully proven obsolete native OpenClaw gateway; an unknown listener is never killed and produces precise `LocalPortConflict` diagnostics. The shared lifecycle lease serializes that destructive work with manual WSL actions. Reconnect is **gateway-pinned, intent-aware, and cancellable** (`GatewayConnectionManager.ReconnectIfCurrentAsync(gatewayId, ct)`), so gateway switches, explicit Disconnect/Stop, and shutdown always win. Repair is single-flight, verifies success by a real operator connection to the same gateway, is per-gateway restart-budget-bounded, and never reads or logs credentials.

## Client instance lifecycle

**Operator client** (`OpenClawGatewayClient`): Single instance at a time, owned by `GatewayConnectionManager`. Created via `GatewayClientFactory.Create()`. Old instance disposed before creating new one. `OperatorClientChanged` event notifies consumers of swaps.

**Node client** (`WindowsNodeClient`): Two mutually exclusive creation paths:
- **Normal**: `NodeConnector` creates it → fires `ClientCreated` → `NodeService.AttachClient()` receives it (no new client created)
- **Local setup**: `NodeService.ConnectAsync()` creates its own client (used only during WSL local gateway setup)

Both paths dispose old clients before creating new ones.

## Setup-code and pairing flow

Setup codes (from QR scan or paste) decode to `{ url, bootstrapToken }` via `SetupCodeDecoder`. The flow:

1. `ApplySetupCodeAsync(code)` decodes and validates
2. Creates/updates a `GatewayRecord` with the bootstrap token
3. Clears stored device tokens (fresh pairing)
4. Connects to the new gateway
5. Gateway returns `hello-ok.auth.deviceToken` after pairing
6. Connection manager persists the device token to the identity file

**Approval boundaries**: `GatewayConnectionManager` leaves node-pair command-trust requests and reapproval pending for explicit operator approval. It may automatically approve and reconnect only an explicitly typed device-pair request used for a device role upgrade.

## Inbound pairing approval (operator)

When **another** device or node requests pairing, the gateway broadcasts `device.pair.requested` / `node.pair.requested` to operators with pairing scope. `OpenClawGatewayClient` refreshes the pending lists and raises `DevicePairListUpdated` / `NodePairListUpdated`, which `GatewayService` forwards via its `PairListsChanged` event.

`PairingApprovalCoordinator` (tray) reconciles those snapshots through the pure `PairingApprovalQueue` (OpenClaw.Connection) into add/resolve deltas, de-duplicating, suppressing already-decided requests, and filtering out the local node's own pending request (handled by the auto-approve path above). For genuinely new requests — when `ShowPairingApprovalDialog` is enabled and the operator holds pairing scope — it raises `ApprovalRequested`, and the app presents a focused **`PairingApprovalDialog`** plus an awareness toast (with a "Review" action). The dialog shows the requester's identity and the **operator scopes being granted** (mapped to friendly text by `PairingScopeDescriptions`), with Approve / Reject / Decide-later. Approve is briefly disabled on each new request to prevent click-through. Approve/Reject call the `IOperatorGatewayClient.{Device,Node}Pair{Approve,Reject}Async` RPCs; the queue advances and the dialog closes when empty. The existing Connections-page "Pending approvals" banner remains as the passive fallback when the dialog is disabled. Pure queue/scope logic is unit-tested in `OpenClaw.Connection.Tests`.

## SSH tunnel integration

`SshTunnelService` manages an SSH local port-forward process and implements `ISshTunnelManager` directly for the connection manager.

When a `GatewayRecord` has `SshTunnel` config, the connection manager starts the tunnel before connecting the WebSocket client to `ws://localhost:<localPort>`. The config stores the SSH daemon port (`sshPort`, default `22`) separately from the remote gateway port forwarded by `-L`.

`SshTunnelSnapshot` provides a read-only point-in-time view of tunnel state for UI consumption (avoids coupling UI to the mutable service).

## MCP-only mode

`EnableMcpServer` and `EnableNodeMode` are independent:

| EnableNodeMode | EnableMcpServer | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| false | false | Operator-only tray app |
| false | true | Local MCP server only; no gateway required |
| true | false | Gateway node only |
| true | true | Gateway node plus local MCP server |

The `EnableMcpServer=true`, `EnableNodeMode=false` path creates a local-only `NodeService` without requiring a gateway credential.

## Tray action UX

Tray actions should never silently no-op on common pairing/configuration issues:

- Chat resolves credentials from the active registry record and per-gateway identity. If no usable credential exists, it opens Connection settings instead.
- Canvas opens only when the Windows node is initialized, paired, and the Canvas capability is enabled in settings; otherwise it opens Connection settings.
- Quick Send uses the live operator client and surfaces scope/pairing errors from gateway calls.
- `system.run` and `system.run.prepare` are gated by `NodeSystemRunEnabled` (default `true` for backward compatibility). When disabled, those commands are dropped from advertised capabilities and invocations are rejected.

## Legacy migration

On first startup with a `GatewayRegistry`, if no active gateway record exists, the app migrates legacy settings credentials:

- `LegacyToken` → `GatewayRecord.SharedGatewayToken`
- `LegacyBootstrapToken` → `GatewayRecord.BootstrapToken`
- Old identity file copied into per-gateway identity directory

Migration is idempotent and deduplicates by URL.

## Signature protocol

The connect handshake uses Ed25519 signatures with v3→v2 fallback:
- Client tries v3 signature first (includes platform and device family)
- If gateway rejects v3, falls back to v2 and remembers for the session
- The `_gatewayNeedsV2Signature` flag persists across reconnects within the same `GatewayConnectionManager` lifetime

## Tests

Connection tests live in `tests/OpenClaw.Connection.Tests/`:

- `ConnectionStateMachineTests` — FSM transitions, derived overall state
- `CredentialResolverTests` — credential precedence for operator and node
- `GatewayConnectionManagerTests` — connect/disconnect/switch, diagnostics, handshake
- `GatewayRegistryTests` / `GatewayRegistryMigrationTests` — persistence, migration
- `InteractiveGatewayCredentialResolverTests` — HTTP credential resolution
- `NodeConnectorTests` — node client lifecycle
- `PairingFlowTests` / `NodePairAutoApproveTests` — pairing lifecycle, device role-upgrade auto-approval, and manual node command-trust boundary
- `SetupCodeFlowTests` / `SetupCodeDecoderTests` — QR code → connect flow
- `StaleEventGuardTests` — generation-guarded event handling
- `SettingsChangeImpactTests` — settings change classification
- `RetryPolicyTests` — backoff policy
- `ConnectionDiagnosticsTests` — ring buffer diagnostics

The heaviest remaining gap is Windows shell UI behavior (tray clicks, tooltip visibility, WinUI menu routing). Cover pure decision logic in unit tests; use manual or integration smoke tests for shell behavior.
