# Windows Node Testing Guide

## Overview

The Windows Node feature allows the tray app to receive commands from the OpenClaw agent (canvas, screenshots, screen recordings, camera, location, notifications, and controlled command execution). This is **experimental** and must be explicitly enabled in Settings.

## How to Enable

1. Open the tray app
2. Right-click → Settings
3. Scroll to "ADVANCED (EXPERIMENTAL)"
4. Toggle "Enable Node Mode" ON
5. Click Save

## Companion-App Setup Guidance

For app-owned local WSL setup, after OpenClaw onboard completes or is explicitly skipped, setup runs the pinned gateway CLI's non-interactive baseline initializer against the final runtime workspace and then injects fixed Windows-node guidance into that workspace's `AGENTS.md`. The injected block is setup-owned and idempotently replaced between managed markers, preserving user-authored content and file permissions outside those markers and leaving OpenClaw source files unchanged.

**Note on the apply script's WSL invocation.** The `WindowsNodeBootstrapContextStep` apply and rollback scripts are piped to `bash -s` via stdin (`RunInWslAsync(..., inputViaStdin: true)`) rather than the default `bash -c` argv path. This is required because `wsl.exe` performs shell variable expansion on argv before invoking bash, which would drop user-defined `$var` references in the multi-line script (`workspace='...'` followed by `mkdir -p "$workspace"` becomes `mkdir -p ""`). See `docs/WSL_EXE_ARGV_PITFALL.md` for the full writeup.

The guidance helps the first companion-app OpenClaw session route Windows desktop, files, screenshots, camera, notifications, browser proxy, and Windows command tasks through the Windows node / `nodes` tool.

## What You Can Test Now

### Agent-driven UI and MCP validation

For changes touching tray UX, Settings, onboarding, chat/canvas, Command Center, Windows node capabilities, local MCP, gateway pairing/connection, permissions, or diagnostics, use `.agents/skills/openclaw-proof-validation/SKILL.md`.

Short version: run required tests, collect a closeout proof pass with `.\run-app-local.ps1 -Isolated` when UI is involved, use computer-use or developer-provided screenshots/output for the active changed UI state, prove MCP with `winnode` or raw JSON-RPC, prove gateway paths when available, and include current-head concrete output under `## Real behavior proof`. Mid-development computer-use/MCP/rubber-duck validation is fine when explicitly requested or needed to unblock work.

### New command MCP contract

Every new Windows node call must be exposed through local MCP and `winnode`: register the capability, update `McpToolBridge.CommandDescriptions`, update `src/OpenClaw.WinNode.Cli/skill.md`, add focused tests, and prove discovery/invocation with `winnode` or raw MCP JSON-RPC.

### 1. Settings Toggle
- Verify the toggle appears in Settings under "ADVANCED"
- Verify it saves and persists across app restarts

### 2. Node Connection
- Enable Node Mode and save
- Watch for "🔌 Node Mode Active" toast notification
- Check logs at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenClawTray\openclaw-tray.log` for:
  ```
  [INFO] Starting Windows Node connection to ws://...
  [INFO] Node connected, waiting for challenge...
  [INFO] Registered capability: screen (2 commands)
  [INFO] All capabilities registered
  [INFO] Node status: Connected
  ```

### 3. Screen Capture Notification
- When the agent captures your screen, you should see "📸 Screen Captured" toast
- This is throttled to max once per 10 seconds

### 4. Command Center
- Open the tray status detail or launch `openclaw://commandcenter`
- In Node Mode, verify the window shows gateway channel health from node `health` events plus a synthesized local Windows node when operator `node.list` is not connected
- Check diagnostics for pairing approval, pending reapproval, stale health, all-stopped channels, allowlist filtering, browser control host availability for `browser.proxy`, and usage-cost gaps
- When only the synthesized local Windows node is available, verify its locally declared capabilities/commands are labeled unverified and are not counted as approved/effective
- For `pending-reapproval`, verify effective capabilities/commands remain unchanged, pending declarations are listed separately, and the copy action emits `openclaw nodes approve <pendingRequestId>`
- During a changed-command handshake, verify authoritative `pending-reapproval` replaces the generic node-pair approval card and exposes only the node-list trust command; explicitly typed device role-upgrade, Node mode off/hidden, and failure cards remain higher priority
- If the gateway omits a safe pending request ID, verify the copy action emits `openclaw nodes pending`, labels it as discovery only, and does not offer reconnect-after-approval yet
- Approve the request explicitly, reconnect the node, and verify the effective capability/command counts update and the pending reapproval warning clears
- Use "Copy fix" only for safe repair commands; privacy-sensitive commands remain informational unless you explicitly opt in on the gateway

## What Requires Gateway Support

These features need the gateway to send `node.invoke` commands:

| Command | Description | Expected Behavior |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| `canvas.present` | Show WebView2 window | Opens floating window with URL or HTML |
| `canvas.hide` | Hide canvas window | Closes the canvas window |
| `canvas.eval` | Execute JavaScript | Runs JS in canvas, returns result |
| `canvas.snapshot` | Capture canvas | Returns base64 PNG of canvas content |
| `canvas.a2ui.pushJSONL` | Legacy A2UI JSONL push | Routes through same renderer path as `canvas.a2ui.push` |
| `screen.snapshot` | Take screenshot | Captures screen, shows notification, returns base64 |
| `screen.record` | Record short screen clip | Returns MP4/base64 metadata; requires explicit gateway allowlist |
| `system.notify` | Show notification | Displays toast notification |
| `system.run` | Controlled command execution | Uses local exec approval policy; `prompt` decisions show a Windows Allow once / Always allow / Deny dialog |
| `system.run.prepare` | Pre-flight command execution | Parses and validates a `system.run` invocation without executing it |
| `system.which` | Resolve executables | Returns absolute paths for requested binaries |
| `camera.list` | Enumerate cameras | Returns device IDs and names |
| `camera.snap` | Capture photo | Returns base64 image (NV12 fallback) |
| `camera.clip` | Capture video clip | Returns MP4/base64 metadata |
| `location.get` | Get Windows location | Uses Windows location permission/settings |
| `device.info` / `device.status` | Device metadata/status | Returns host/app/locale plus battery/storage/network/uptime payloads |
| `browser.proxy` | Proxy browser-control host requests | Requires Browser proxy bridge enabled, a compatible browser-control host listening on gateway port + 2, and matching browser-control auth |
| `tts.speak` | Speak text aloud | Requires Text-to-speech playback enabled in Settings; gateway mode also requires `tts.speak` in `gateway.nodes.allowCommands` |
| `stt.transcribe` | Bounded microphone transcription | Requires Speech-to-text enabled in Settings; uses local Whisper.net |
| `stt.listen` | Voice-activity microphone transcription | Returns when the user stops speaking or timeout expires |
| `stt.status` | Speech-to-text readiness | Returns Whisper.net model download/readiness state |

### Cancelling an invocation

The gateway may send the `node.invoke.cancel` event with
`payload.invokeId` matching an active `node.invoke.request`. The Windows node
cancels only that invocation and completes its original result with
`ok: false, error: "cancelled"`; unknown or already-completed IDs are ignored.
The legacy `payload.requestId` spelling is also accepted for compatibility.
Operation completion is the linearization point: once capability execution
returns and atomically marks the invocation complete, later cancellation is too
late and the completed result is preserved.

For local MCP, send a JSON-RPC `notifications/cancelled` notification with
`params.requestId` matching the active `tools/call` JSON-RPC ID. Cancellation
must stop queued camera admission, recording delays/frame waits, and active
recording cleanup rather than only abandoning the HTTP waiter.

## Capabilities Advertised

When the node connects, it advertises these capabilities:
- `canvas` - WebView2-based canvas window
- `screen` - Screen snapshot and recording via Windows.Graphics.Capture
- `system` - Notifications, command execution (`system.run`, `system.run.prepare`, `system.which`), exec approval policy
- `camera` - MediaCapture photo/video capture (frame reader fallback)
- `location` - Windows.Devices.Geolocation
- `device` - Host/app metadata and lightweight status
- `browser` - Local `browser.proxy` bridge to a browser-control host on gateway port + 2, when enabled in Settings
- `tts` - Windows speech synthesis or ElevenLabs playback, when enabled in Settings
- `stt` - Local speech-to-text via Whisper.net, when enabled in Settings

Local MCP clients also see MCP-only `app.*` commands such as `app.navigate`, `app.status`, `app.chat.snapshot`/`app.chat.send`/`app.chat.reset`, and `app.chat.queue.list`/`app.chat.queue.cancel`. Connection diagnostics and setup tools live under `app.connection.*`; use `app.connection.status` to inspect active gateway, operator/node credential state, MCP runtime status, browser proxy caveat, pending approval commands, and recent diagnostics, and `app.connection.gateways` to list saved gateway records without token values. These are local testing and automation hooks registered with the tray's MCP server and are not advertised to the gateway WebSocket.

## Security Features

- **URL Validation**: Canvas blocks `file://`, `javascript:`, localhost, private IPs, IPv6 localhost
- **Screen Capture Notification**: User is notified when screen snapshots are captured
- **Screen Recording Allowlist**: `screen.record` must be explicitly allowed by the gateway and does not leave a hidden local MP4 copy on Windows
- **Command Center Redaction**: recent node invoke activity records command name, status, duration, node id, and privacy class only; it does not store base64 payloads, screenshots, recordings, tokens, or command arguments
- **Node Mode Toggle**: Must be explicitly enabled by user
- **Command Validation**: Only alphanumeric commands with dots/hyphens allowed

## Troubleshooting

### Node doesn't connect
- Check the active gateway in Connection settings. Gateway records live in `%APPDATA%\OpenClawTray\gateways.json`; post-pairing device tokens live under `%APPDATA%\OpenClawTray\gateways\<gateway-id>\device-key-ed25519.json`.
- Check logs for connection errors
- If logs report that the saved device identity could not be loaded, fix access to the existing identity file or use an explicit reset/re-pair action. The tray preserves an unreadable or corrupt identity instead of replacing it automatically.
- Verify gateway is running and accessible
- If only a bootstrap token exists, finish pairing or approve the device; paired device tokens take precedence on future connects.

### No "Node Mode Active" notification
- Ensure Windows notifications are enabled for the app
- Check if notification settings in the app are enabled

### Browser control stays enabled but never declares `browser`
- Setup-code / QR pairing can connect with a device token and leave `GatewayRecord.SharedGatewayToken` empty. Browser control will not declare `browser` / `browser.proxy` until a shared gateway token is saved for that gateway.
- Expect Connection capability pills to say **Needs gateway shared token** (not "Enabled, not active yet") only while the node WebSocket session is live and the shared token is missing. Disconnected or attached-but-disconnected states should ask for reconnect, not a token paste. The pill keeps that short label; its tooltip matches Command Center remediation detail.
- Command Center, Connection pill tooltips, and `app.connection.status` / `app.connection.gateways` use the same live-session rule for the shared-token caveat. For a remote (non-loopback) gateway without an explicit `BrowserControlPort` or SSH browser-proxy forward — including SSH tunnels whose effective URL is `127.0.0.1` — that caveat also mentions the endpoint/forward requirement; the shared token alone is not enough for usable remote browser.proxy.
- Enter the gateway shared token in Settings, save, and reconnect node mode. Bootstrap tokens are not the shared gateway token.

### `browser.proxy` reports no browser-control host
- Confirm the Browser proxy bridge toggle is enabled in Settings, then save and reconnect or re-pair if the gateway keeps an older command snapshot.
- The bridge is local-only: it calls `http://127.0.0.1:<gateway-port+2>` from Windows. For a gateway on `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`, the browser-control host must listen on `127.0.0.1:18791`.
- In managed SSH tunnel mode, keep Browser proxy bridge enabled so the tray forwards local gateway port + 2 to remote gateway port + 2. Settings shows a selectable preview of the exact `ssh -N -L ...` command.
- If using a manual SSH tunnel, add both forwards, for example: `ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 -L 18791:127.0.0.1:18791 <user>@<host>`. If the SSH daemon is not listening on port 22, include `-p <ssh-port>`. If local and remote gateway ports differ, forward `<local-gateway-port+2>` to `127.0.0.1:<remote-gateway-port+2>`.
- Advanced split/remote topologies can pin the browser-control listener with the active gateway record's `BrowserControlPort` field in `%APPDATA%\OpenClawTray\gateways.json`. This value is a local TCP port on Windows and is scoped to that gateway record. Configure it only for a trusted browser-control forward, because `browser.proxy` sends the saved shared gateway token to the selected local listener for browser-control authentication. When a gateway uses SSH, tunnel-derived `localPort + 2` browser-control routing is used only when that gateway's managed tunnel has `IncludeBrowserProxyForward` enabled; otherwise set `BrowserControlPort` to a trusted manual forward.
- A local SSH forward is not enough if the remote browser-control host is not running. Command Center port diagnostics should show whether the local gateway and browser-control ports are listening and which process owns them.
- If Command Center shows the browser-control port listening but `browser.proxy` returns an auth error, verify the Windows Settings gateway token matches the browser-control host token/password. QR/bootstrap pairing can connect the node without saving a shared gateway token, but browser-control auth may still require one.
- A local smoke can verify the host dependency without proving gateway invoke auth: start the upstream browser-control host with a temporary no-secret config, confirm `http://127.0.0.1:<gateway-port+2>/` and `/tabs` return HTTP 200, then stop the captured host process. The full parity smoke is not complete until `openclaw nodes invoke --command browser.proxy` succeeds through the active gateway.

### Canvas window doesn't appear
- Check logs for `canvas.present` command received
- Verify URL is not blocked by security validation

### Camera permission denied
- If you see "Camera access blocked", enable camera access for desktop apps in Windows Privacy settings
- Packaged MSIX builds will show the system consent prompt automatically

### Local sandbox validation
- Sandbox integration tests are intended for local Windows development machines and may skip when the required local sandbox prerequisites are unavailable.
- Build the tray app before running local sandbox validation so the required sandbox helper binaries are present in the app output.
- For MXC-related merge validation, prefer the formal script below because it sets the required gates and fails if MXC is skipped.

  ```powershell
  .\scripts\validate-mxc-e2e.ps1
  ```

### Full Gateway `system.run` MXC runtime proof
- The focused E2E below provisions a fresh WSL Gateway, starts an isolated tray instance, sets a local exec approval rule through MCP, invokes `system.run` through the real Gateway `node.invoke` path, and verifies tray MXC diagnostics show contained `mxc-direct-appc` execution for both allowed execution and denied writes to the tray data directory.
- Run it when validating the Gateway/Windows node runtime path, not just direct MCP or shared library behavior.
- GitHub-hosted Actions runners do not provide a working MXC/AppContainer runtime. The regular cloud E2E matrix should report these MXC proofs as skipped while still running the rest of setup-connect. Run the proof on a local MXC-enabled Windows machine. Only set `OPENCLAW_RUN_MXC_E2E=1` in GitHub Actions when using an MXC-enabled self-hosted runner.
- Use `.\scripts\validate-mxc-e2e.ps1` for normal local validation. It sets `OPENCLAW_RUN_E2E` and `OPENCLAW_RUN_MXC_E2E`, runs the real Gateway MXC proofs, and fails if the MXC proof skips. `-AllowSkip` is only for documenting a non-MXC host, not for merge validation of MXC-related work.
- When reproducing this manually against an existing Gateway, make sure `gateway.nodes.allowCommands` includes `system.run`, `system.run.prepare`, and `system.which`, then approve any `pending-reapproval` request with `openclaw nodes approve <pendingRequestId>`. The node can advertise `system.run` while the Gateway still blocks it until both gates are updated.

  ```powershell
  .\build.ps1
  $env:OPENCLAW_REPO_ROOT = (Get-Location).Path
  $env:OPENCLAW_RUN_E2E = "1"
  dotnet test .\tests\OpenClaw.E2ETests\OpenClaw.E2ETests.csproj `
    --no-restore `
    --filter "FullyQualifiedName~RealGateway_SystemRun_ExecutesThroughWindowsNodeMxcSandbox" `
    --logger "console;verbosity=normal" `
    -r win-x64
  ```

- Expected proof markers:
  - Gateway response contains `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_SYSTEM_RUN_MXC_OK` with `exitCode=0`.
  - The denied-write proof targets a fresh file under the isolated tray data directory, returns non-zero, and leaves that file absent.
  - `openclaw-tray.log` contains `[mxc] system.run sandbox request` with `executor=mxc-direct-appc`, `contained=True`, and `shell=cmd`.
  - `openclaw-tray.log` contains `[mxc] system.run sandbox result` with `containment=mxc` for both the successful execution and the denied write.
- E2E artifacts are written under `TestResults\E2E\<run-id>` and skip known secret-bearing files such as gateway records and settings.
